# airbnb

In this project a dataset related to airbnb is analyzed. the dataset inclused features such as neighborhood, price, type of rooms, number of beds in the room and geoghraphical location info. 
as the first step some exploration has been done to understand the structure of dataset and after that data cleaning is performed which includes checking for null or duplicate valuesv and trying to remove them for better further analysis.
the outlier detection using box plots and their removal is also performed so that the visualizations lead to a better result. and the plots are represented before and after those removals and the differences can be seen easily.

Next step was starting with some analysis for which they are divided into different sections. there are Univariate analysis in which a single variable has been analyzed and visualized for example the distribution of the price.

then it continues with some Bivariate analysis that actually referes to the relationships between two different variables, as for example in this project the price in each neighbourhood considering the room type is plotted. Moreover a scatterplot is represented to show how the price affects the number of reviews.
in order to have a more comprehensive idea of the relationships among variables, pairwise plot is a suitable option to showcase this relationships at once which are presented in jupyter file uploaded here.
another plot that could help in understanding the effect of one variable on others is a heatmap which clearly shows the correlation among different variables and can interpreted either by numbers or the color palette or even both.

In addition, a geographical map is also plotted to have an understanding of the prices in different geographical area(different neighborhoods)
